        <h2>Enrolling in a Degree</h2>
        <h3><strong>Deciding on a Degreee</strong></h3>
        The University of Newcastle has degrees for any role you are looking for. The first thing you want to do is decide what degree you want to partake in. This can be a difficult decision, especially if you don’t know what you want to do in the future. Finding an area that you want to pursue is easy, you can just look at our catalogue of degrees and see what interests you. </bre>
        <h3><strong>Deciding on a Major</strong></h3>
        Once you’ve decided on a degree, you must decide what you will be majoring in. Each degree has it’s own set of majors, a more specific area of the degree that you want your courses to be based around. Once you’ve picked a major, you can have a look at the Program Handbook. </bre>
        <h3><strong>Program Handbook</strong></h3>
        The Program Handbook has all of the information you need for your degree. Here you can view what courses you will be doing for your degree. This may help you on deciding what degree you would like to choose. There are some courses that are electives, which can be selected as a course regardless of what degree or major you are doing. 
        You must also decide how long you want to study the degree for. The length of each degree varies, and can vary further depending on if you’re doing University full-time or part-time. 
        Once you’re happy with a degree, you can freely enrol in it.</bre>
